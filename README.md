# caseConverter

I need to write a long piece of text.

Suddenly, it turned out that it has to be in the upper case or vice-versa. 

I Don't really need to rewrite the entire text? Of course not. Let's me create a tool that automatically changes the case.

I can convert the text into different cases and save them automatically  as text file, excellent!
